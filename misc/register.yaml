# no charaters less than 32 is always implied. except CR is allowable if the input box is multiline.
# not sure if we should have a 'required' boolean parameter. it seems redundant when we can just leave min_length at 0.
# but it may become relevant. i said somewhere else that DirtyFork aren't called when the field isn't required. but i think that was a wrong decision anyway. 
# note: it's very important to have max_lengths! otherwise someone could sabotage your BBS with like a 1-gigabyte handle or bio or email or something..
# fields with undefined lengths should generally automatically set themselves according to the max_length of the contents.
# length, height is for the field, max_length is for the contents.
# todo: i suppose we should add type: int, float, or string to our parameters 
# should support drop-down lists. we really need one for time_zone. 
# problem with this .yaml approach to input screens: no room for anything but the top blurb and input field names.
# how would i structure it so i could register multiple input fields with any given destination and the class knows how to switch between input fields depending on what the user enters (
# (or on mouse clicks)?
# but that wouldn't work very will with the ability to scroll up and down the entire page as needed to fit all the input fields'. it would be doable, though.
# problem: how do we submit? <enter> should go to the next field.
# for now, let's just forgo having entry fields being switchable between, and just enter and validate them sequentially.
