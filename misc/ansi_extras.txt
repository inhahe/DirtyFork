see 1000h.txt

ESC[22m - Bold off
ESC[24m - Underline off
ESC[25m - Blink off
ESC[27m - Reverse off
ESC[28m - Invisible off

On Off      Attribute
1  21 or 22 Bold (21 is sometimes "double underline", 22 is more reliable) - 22 works in syncterm
4  24       Underline
5  25       Blink - works in syncterm
7  27       Reverse - doesn't seem to work in syncterm
8  28       Invisible

esc[100m - esc[107m - bright background (as opposed to blink) - doesn't seem to work in syncterm

ESC[ Ps SP q
Note the space character before q. Values:
Ps	Cursor Style
0,1 	Blinking block
2	Steady block
3	Blinking underline
4	Steady underline
5	Blinking bar (some terminals)
6	Steady bar (some terminals)

So ESC[2 q gives you a non-blinking block cursor.
Support varies:

xterm: yes
VT520+: yes
Windows Terminal: yes
PuTTY: maybe not
SyncTERM: worth testing - doesn't work on SyncTERM.

esc[?25l - hide cursor - works in SyncTERM
