process ctrl chars - don't print 7

"todo: this is wrong"

ask claude how to make a function that only runs when .drain() is called  so we can do the same thing for ansi_move that we did for ansi_color

make ansi_nowrap() not async

todo: option to change terminal type

check esc[22m in putty
check the ansi command that affects how things work with scroll regions

- instantiate InputFields class
- call instance.getinputfield for each field. they return after composing the input field but stay attached to instance. a class within a class? i guess it doesn't have to be one.
- they render at the current cursor positions.
- call instance.getsubmitbutton to get a submit button
- call instance.runpage, which captures input until submitted
- can move between inputs with arrows, enter, tab, or mouse clicks.
goes backward or forward through the
inputs list in the order in which they were created
- indicate which one is active with colored boxes. how for fields without boxes? grey out all the others?

in "del", it is unnecessary to render a string of fill. just render one to replace the character that was there.

write initial fill

make config stop recursing when x.format_map() == child  x.format_map()

is there an irc channel that BBSs relay to?

class InputFields
class InputField

a = InputFields()
b = InputField(a)
while 1:
  dest = dest.run()

or
class InputFields:
  def run():
    while 1:
      key = getkey(user)
      self.inputfields[n].do_input(key)

first way allows better reuse for using outside of a class, but we could no longer simply call inputfield(), we'd need to
instance = inputfield()
while 1: instance.do_key(get_key(user))

we could have InputField read from getkey() when it's not passed an instance of InputFields and use do_key() when it is

class InputField:
  def __init__(self, a=None, user=None)):
    if not a:
      while 1: self.do_key(getkey(user))

or

class InputField:
  def __init__(self, user=None, a=None):
    if not a:
      self.run()

class InputFields:
  def __init__(self, user):
    self.user=user
    self.fields=[]
  def getfield():
    self.fields.append(InputField(user))
  def run():
    x=0
    while 1:
      x = self.fields[x].run()
