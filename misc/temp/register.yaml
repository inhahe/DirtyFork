# no charaters less than 32 is always implied. except CR is allowable if the input box is multiline.
# not sure if we should have a 'required' boolean parameter. it seems redundant when we can just leave min_length at 0.
# but it may become relevant. i said somewhere else that DirtyFork aren't called when the field isn't required. but i think that was a wrong decision anyway. 
# note: it's very important to have max_lengths! otherwise someone could sabotage your BBS with like a 1-gigabyte handle or bio or email or something..
# fields with undefined lengths should generally automatically set themselves according to the max_length of the contents.
# length, height is for the field, max_length is for the contents.
# todo: i suppose we should add type: int, float, or string to our parameters 
# should support drop-down lists. we really need one for time_zone.
