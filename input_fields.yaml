# define colors for entries marked as invalid?
# do we validate every time the user enters a character, every time they tab away from a field, or every time they try to submit? make it an option here?

# we combine input when there's more than X characters in Y seconds. 
# i have no idea if these values for X and Y are good.
# but I'd bet nobody can type that fast..
# should we put these values in the DirtyFork.yaml instead?
# oh, wait, they could send 1000 characters and i wouldn't be buffering yet because it wouldn't have been one second yet..
# i think I need something more complex, but it would be total guessing of the best values.
# that means as long as there are 2 characters in .01 seconds, it buffers, and as long as there are 20 characters in 1 second, it buffers
# i think this is totally wrong but this is toward the right direction.
# buffer can be of any complexity - any number of tuples.
